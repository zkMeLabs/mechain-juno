# Setup
Setting up Juno is pretty straightforward. It requires three things to be done:
1. Install Juno.
1. Initialize the configuration.
2. Start the parser.

## Installing Juno
In order to install Juno you are required to have [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/) installed on your machine. Once you have it, the first thing to do is to clone the GitHub repository. To do this you can run

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/forbole/juno.git
```

Then, you need to install the binary. To do this, run

```shell
$ make install
```

This will put the `juno` binary inside your `$GOPATH/bin` folder. You should now be able to run `juno` to make sure it's installed:

```shell
$ juno
A Cosmos chain data aggregator. It improves the chain's data accessibility
by providing an indexed database exposing aggregated resources and models such as blocks, validators, pre-commits, 
transactions, and various aspects of the governance module. 
juno is meant to run with a GraphQL layer on top so that it even further eases the ability for developers and
downstream clients to answer queries such as "What is the average gas cost of a block?" while also allowing
them to compose more aggregate and complex queries.

Usage:
  juno [command]

Available Commands:
  help        Help about any command
  init        Initializes the configuration files
  parse       Parse individual data (eg. the genesis file)
  start       Start parsing the blockchain data
  version     Print the version information

Flags:
  -h, --help          help for juno
      --home string   Set the home folder of the application, where all files will be stored (default "/home/riccardo/.juno")

Use "juno [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Initializing the configuration
In order to correctly parse and store the data based on your requirements, Juno allows you to customize its behavior via a TOML file called `config.yaml`. In order to create the first instance of the `config.yaml` file you can run

```shell
$ juno init
```

This will create such file inside the `~/.juno` folder.  
Note that if you want to change the folder used by Juno you can do this using the `--home` flag:

```shell
$ juno init --home /path/to/my/folder
```

Once the file is created, you are required to edit it and change the different values. To do this you can run

```shell
$ nano ~/.juno/config.yaml
```

For a better understanding of what each section and field refers to, please read the [config reference](config.md).

## Running Juno
Once the configuration file has been setup, you can run Juno using the following command:

```shell
$ juno start
```

If you are using a custom folder for the configuration file, please specify it using the `--home` flag:


```shell
$ juno start --home /path/to/my/config/folder
```

We highly suggest you running Juno as a system service so that it can be restarted automatically in the case it stops. To do this you can run:

```shell
$ sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/juno.service > /dev/null <<EOF
[Unit]
Description=Juno parser
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=$USER
ExecStart=$GOPATH/bin/juno parse
Restart=always
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

Then you need to enable and start the service:

```shell
$ sudo systemctl enable juno
$ sudo systemctl start juno
```
